# Funtion
This is a game which help beginners learn Javascript by writting codes to control a character. You have to help your character save his friends and get out of a maze which contains impostors (your character will die if he meet them). You will have a game screen (1/2 width), a tutorial, and an embedded Js compiler to write codes and convert your codes into movements for your character. Just try it out !
